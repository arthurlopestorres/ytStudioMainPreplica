# ytStudioMainPreplica
In this basic training project, I replicate YouTube Studio's Main Page with it's basic functionalities.

///////////
Tecnologies envolved:
HTML5
CSS3
JavaScript/Typescript

///////////
Resolutions supported (width): any >= 768px

///////////
Experience gathered:
1- I had to learn and practice manipulating image properties (SVGs);
2- I learned and practiced css in some specific ways such as changing scrollbar properties and manipulating element's estate to make sure it fit the expected behavior
3- This was the first project I used Typescript and css rooting, so there is certainly a lot to improve there.
4- I compartimentalized components of the page to make it easier to manipulate and fix behavior separetly (the css is in different files as well as the js).
5- I changed configs of the tsconfig.json file to make Typescript help me code better and faster.
6- In general: HTML5, CSS3 and Javascript(TS) manipulation

Challanges faced:
1- I had to search for a way to use modules (node.js) to export and import TS files amongst each other. At the beginning, for some reason, importing a TS file in another TS file was not allowing the code to be read properly which caused a "xxxxx is not defined" bug quite difficult to figure out how to fix, but I managed and I'm happy about it.
2- I wasn't used to manipulating opacity in elements to make the hover effect in css so I faced some dificulties manipulating only display: none; which made learn how to manipulate opacity and visibility to reach the expect behavior quite easier.
3- I also faced some dificulties with CSS animations. I googled and figured out how to implement customed transitioning to create some sort of "delay" when hover is applied.
